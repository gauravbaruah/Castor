# 100 Random Seeds

### Experiment

What is the variation in performance of a simple CNN based neural network model
when it is initialized by different random seeds?


## Files 

- ``generate_random_seeds.py``: Generates random seeds to be used by different versions of the sm_cnn model.
- ``100-random-seeds.txt``: A file containing a list of 100 seeds generated by ``generate-random-seeds.py``.
- ``run_sm_cnn_with_seeds.sh``: Wrapper script that runs ../sm_cnn with a range of random seeds.
- ``get_sm_cnn_performance.sh``: Fetches MAP, MRR, times, etc from 100 log files
- ``compute_stats.py``: computes mean, confidence intervals, medians etc for performance metrics

## Details

- ``torch.manual_seed(...)``, ``np.random.seed(...)``, and/or ``random.seed(...)`` are all set via a new argument
**``--random-seed``** in sm_cnn

- Models to test include
    1. PyTorch sm_cnn
    2. lua torch sm_cnn

## To Run

Generating the 100 random seeds
```
python generate_random_seeds.py 100 > 100-random-seeds.txt
```

Training sm_cnn with a range of random seeds
```
bash run_sm_cnn_with_seeds.sh 100-random-seeds.txt 1 10
```
This command will train 10 sm_cnn models with the first 10 random seeds in the 100-random-seeds.txt file, 
and store the training log and results in sm_cnn.seed=*.log
