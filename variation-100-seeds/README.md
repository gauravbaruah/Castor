# 100 Random Seeds

### Experiment

What is the variation in performance of a simple CNN based neural network model
when it is initialized by different random seeds?


## Files 

- ``generate_random_seeds.py``: Generates random seeds to be used by different versions of the sm_cnn model.
- ``100-random-seeds.txt``: A file containing a list of 100 seeds generated by ``generate-random-seeds.py``.
- ``run_sm_cnn_with_seeds.py``: Wrapper script that runs ../sm_cnn with a range of random seeds.

## Details

- np.random.seed()
