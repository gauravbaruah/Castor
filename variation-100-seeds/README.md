# 100 Random Seeds

### Experiment

What is the variation in performance of a simple CNN based neural network model
when it is initialized by different random seeds?


## Files 

- ``generate_random_seeds.py``: Generates random seeds to be used by different versions of the sm_cnn model.
- ``100-random-seeds.txt``: A file containing a list of 100 seeds generated by ``generate-random-seeds.py``.
- ``run_sm_cnn_with_seeds.py``: Wrapper script that runs ../sm_cnn with a range of random seeds.

## Details

- ``torch.manual_seed(...)``, ``np.random.seed(...)``, and/or ``random.seed(...)`` are all set via a new **argument
``--random_seed`` in sm_cnn**

- Models to test include
    1. PyTorch sm_cnn
    2. lua torch sm_cnn

## To Run

```
python generate_random_seeds.py 100 > 100-random-seeds.txt
```
